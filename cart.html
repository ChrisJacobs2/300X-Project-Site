    <!-- 
        Show 2 items in the cart
        Second item has quantity of 2
        
        Cart page needs:
        Small picutre
        Name
        Price
        A field to enter quantity
        A button to click after the quantity has been changed
        A button to remove the item from the cart

        Total price of all items in the cart
        We also need to show the price per group of items (so like 2 engine cleaners at $5 each show $10 next to the listing)

        Regarding the total: 
        Add 6.75% sales tax
        $15 delivery fee (we can probably make it more because ya know big ass truck parts)
