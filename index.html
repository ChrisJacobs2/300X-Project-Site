    <!-- Body Mods, Performance and Tuning, Accessories, Cabin -->
    <!-- These items would have a drop down, so Accessories might
        include "Winch, Ornaments, etc" -->
    <!-- Maybe a button that says "Pimp my Truck that links to a random product
        from a list of wacky ones like "super turbo" or "bed mounted SAM" -->
    <!-- The side bar would have the search bar on it as well. -->
